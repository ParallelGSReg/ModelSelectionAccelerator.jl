Using user-provided keywords or phrases, ResearchAccelerator.jl will interact with Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, among others, to obtain a potentially relevant bibliography. Then a subset of them with available abstracts, references, and keywords will be used to provide citation networks, and keywords/citations statistics. Finally, a machine learning system with modern Large Language Models will be used to generate, based on articles’ abstracts, a similarity network to provide users with additional information for a deeper search among related bibliography. This network will be exported to the Latex document as a table, a figure, and to a standard output file to be viewed using graph plotting and analysis tools such as Gephi.","category":"page"},{"location":"#ModelSelection-package","page":"Home","title":"ModelSelection package","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"ResearchAccelerator.jl package uses ModelSelection.jl.
